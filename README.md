# Myr Interview Example
A basic skill system, implemented using Unity Engine 2021.3.1f1

Time Taken: Around 3 hours.

## Instructions:
- WASD to for movement
- Look around / aim with the mouse
- Press 1-7 on the keyboard to select a skill

The selected skill will fire a projectile of that type, and on collision with an object apply the skill's properties.

## Notes:
- I implemented this First Person Shooter style game frame scratch.
- The floor object ignores any projectiles
- Each skill is a Scriptable Object, to allow easy creation of new abilites, and modification of existing abilities (Try changing the colour of 'ScriptableObjects/Red' Modifier!)
